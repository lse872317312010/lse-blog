# Status list

Nowadays, more and more chinese university students find theirselves get more grows my competing with the collegues or peers, it seems like we are fighting for a meet whitch will defeat each other. when you get tired, everyone can catch that timing, pushing you to lay down. The world is definetly a shit for all the aspacet. While there is a run-phlosophy, a methord set for chinese students and ordinary people to get out of their comfort zone, fighting for there harmony life without endless competing. But the pholosophy in my perspective is absolutely another juan-format which is proved a hard and shiting things. Hence our chinese student can never find a place to lie down, we must fight ,fight for the profit ,the future, the beauty. The all pholosophy is fight, like the awful game.
