## Resource We Need

Before we get into society, we should handle some items that we need for every tiny issue.

### Tools to know what you should do

1. `google`, `bing` etc. The search engine is the key to search ordinary issues. If we need more useful info, we need some professional site. However, if we want to learn and search `Chinese` info, we will usually get stuck with trash info.
    *   `stack overflow` is a professional site for programmers. It is much more useful than CSDN, the *copy site*.

2. **English** is important for `run-philosophy`. But it is hard to progress in writing without current input and output.
    *   *English Writing skill*
    *   *English comprehension skill* is the skill you should get for understanding issues in the area. And it is the academic language in researching.
    *   *English listening skill* is another weakness for Chinese students.
    *   *English speaking skill* is the most important for living if you go abroad, while it is the biggest obstacle for us to overcome since we seldom have the chance to communicate with native speakers.

    <h4>How to improve?</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>`listen`: to listen to `ASMR` and `video`, it is bad though.</li>
        <li>`comprehension`: to read the document like a programming handbook.</li>
        <li>`speak`:
            <ol>
                <li>Just read aloud to yourself in a `kongkuang` place.</li>
                <li>Talk with foreigners in English if you have the chance.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>`writing`: writing this md file is already an exercise in writing. But to write more high-level words and expressions, we should use some tools.</li>
    </ul>

3. `Programming tool chain` is necessary to optimize your dev, debug, test, or publish process. It is your helpful assistant.
4. `Prove material` is the input for every process if you want to get the output (here we call the output the destination).
